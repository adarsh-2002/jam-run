              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                JamRun was born in 2024 when a group of passionate runners in Jamshedpur 
                decided to create a community that would bring together people who love running. 
                What started as a small group of 3 runners has now grown into a vibrant community 
                of over 100 members. We're basically the Avengers of running, but with more sweat and better snacks!
              </p>
              <p>
                We believe that running is not just about fitness, but about building connections, 
                supporting each other, and exploring the beautiful city of Jamshedpur together. 
                Our community welcomes runners of all levels - from complete beginners to marathon veterans.
                Remember: the best runs end with chai and samosas! ‚òïü•ü
